Not currently a pandoc option, but you might be able to work around it with a small find and replace script: https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/1517


```haskell
dumbDownChar :: Char -> String
dumbDownChar '\160' = " "
dumbDownChar '\8211' = "--"
dumbDownChar '\8212' = "---"
dumbDownChar '\8230' = "..."
dumbDownChar '\8216' = "'"
dumbDownChar '\8217' = "'"
dumbDownChar '\8220' = "\""
dumbDownChar '\8221' = "\""
dumbDownChar c = [c]

dumbDown :: Inline -> [Inline]
dumbDown (Str cs) = [Str $ concatMap dumbDownChar cs]
dumbDown (Quoted SingleQuote ils) = [Str "'"] ++ ils ++ [Str "'"]
dumbDown (Quoted DoubleQuote ils) = [Str "\""] ++ ils ++ [Str "\""]
dumbDown il = [il]
```
